HardCoded
Code Quizlet

The assigned project was to create a quiz with questions and answers related to coding.

The finished application would need to allow the user to select a start button to initiate the quiz and then a timer would begin to count down from a set amount of time.

If the user answered a question incorrectly, they would be penalized by additional seconds being deducted from the timer.

The application required HTML, CSS and JavaScript to produce the required functionalities.

Here is how the beginning of the quiz looks when loaded:

After the user decides to play the questions and answers appear:

![Questions Medium](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95048609/152702634-827d0228-03e0-475e-be23-bd31e4151c94.jpeg)

The questions container will disappear at the end of the quiz and the user will be presented with the option to save their score and initials..

![End quiz Medium](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95048609/152702731-612a8847-7753-4100-b076-150c83c8a8ad.jpeg)

If the user chooses to save their score they will be taken to a new tab with saved high scores..

I eventually want to add some code that would change the clickable answer buttons to red or green depending on if the question was answered incorrectly or correctly.
